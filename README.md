https://youtu.be/JyuStjP7WeU - Week 11 Modified project details using UPDATE statement. Delete a project and all child rows using the DELETE statement. Observe that using ON DELETE CASCADE automatically deletes child rows with a foreign key relationship. Use the return value from PreparedStatement.executeUpdate() to determine if a row was updated or deleted.
